                <h2>Aston Villa confirms status
                    as unlikely Premier League title contender, defeating Arsenal and Manchester City in same week
                </h2> <!-- Article Title -->

                <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>Aston Villa’s rise under Spanish manager Unai Emery over the past year has been steady, if
                    unspectacular: first jumping clear of the relegation fight, then reaching the Europa Conference
                    League.</p>
                <p>However, suddenly, this season, the team has confirmed its credentials as a genuine Premier League
                    title contender with a 1-0 victory over Arsenal on Saturday, just three days after defeating
                    perennial powerhouse Manchester City.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Villa scored the first and only goal of the match after just seven
                    minutes in front of a raucous Villa Park, following yet another fast start for the Birmingham club.
                </p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <p>Leon Bailey escaped down the wing, pulling the Arsenal defense wide, before crossing to captain John
                    McGinn who took a touch, turned and rifled the ball into the net for a well-worked goal.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Arsenal had several opportunities to equalize, but some spectacular goalkeeping from 2023 Yashin
                    Trophy winner Emi Martínez, a controversial decision to not award the Gunners a penalty when Gabriel
                    Jesus went down in the box and a disallowed last-gasp goal for handball ensured that Villa held on
                    for a club-record 15th consecutive victory at home.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>After Villa defeated Manchester City on Wednesday, Pep Guardiola labeled the Birmingham side as
                    potential title contenders, talk that Emery has been quick to play down.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Inevitably, after a week in which it has defeated two title contenders, such talk will only intensify
                    and McGinn quipped afterwards that he is “banning the T-word.”</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>“It’s gameweek 16, so there’s a long way to go,” he said, according to the BBC. “We respect everyone
                    round about us who have been in this position for years. We’re newbies – if we can keep it up, we’ll
                    see.”</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <p>When Emery was appointed in October last year, Villa was marooned towards the bottom of the league,
                    but the four-time Europa League-winning Spanish manager has transformed the club and its players,
                    building a well-drilled team capable of taking on the league’s best.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
