                <h2>LeBron James wins IST MVP as Los Angeles Lakers hold
                    off Indiana Pacers for debut NBA Cup title</h2> <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/sport/3.jpg" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>LeBron James lifted both the NBA Cup and the MVP award for the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament
                    (IST) as the Los Angeles
                    Lakers held off the upstart Indiana Pacers, 123-109, in Las Vegas.</p>
                <p>Led by a monster performance from Anthony Davis – who racked up 41 points, 20 rebounds, five assists
                    and four blocks on the night – and a solid defensive effort, the Lakers managed to win an
                    entertaining final where, despite always leading after going up
                    13-11 four minutes into the game, they could not shake off the persistent Pacers.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>While the Lakers offense did its part, shooting 53.4% from the field, it was the defense which
                    ultimately won the game, holding what was an efficient and
                    impressive Indiana offense during the IST to 36.8% shooting from the floor.</p>

                <p>However, despite Los Angeles leading by as many as 11 late in the third, the Pacers – pushed on by
                    newfound NBA star Tyrese Haliburton, who had 20 points and 11 assists – kept fighting back,
                    cutting the lead to as little as three multiple times in the fourth quarter.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>But led by a strong defensive effort in the final six minutes of the game and Davis, who had 14
                    points in
                    the final period, the Lakers slowly pulled away to win the first ever NBA Cup.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>James and Austin Reaves, who had 24 and 28 points on the night respectively, rounded out the strong
                    LA offense
                    that powered the Purple and Gold to even more NBA history on Saturday night.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>After the game, LeBron, who was awarded the IST MVP for his strong tournament-wide performances, was
                    asked about Davis’ performance in the final and
                    indicated the pair know each other’s capability to step up on any given night.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>“I know who I am, he knows who he is, so there’s no friction. We’re not trying to compete with one
                    another on the court or on a lifestyle
                    basis. He knows who he is, I know who I am,” James said after the final, per ESPN</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->

                <p>“The only thing we’re trying to do is hold each other accountable when we get to work and try
                    to be the best we can be for each other, and when one is not going well, try to pick
                    each other up,” the four-time NBA champion added. “There’s no jealousy. There’s not a jealous bone
                    in our bodies. We’re never jealous of one another. Ever.”
