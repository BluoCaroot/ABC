                <h2>The 4 key events that led to UPenn President Liz Magill’s resignation
                </h2> <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/tech/f9a3fc0.webp" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>When Liz Magill was hired to be the 27th leader of the nearly 300-year-old University of Pennsylvania 20 months ago, she was academic royalty. On Saturday, she resigned in disgrace.</p>
                <p>Born into a family of lawyers and judges, Magill had spent decades rising to the top ranks of academia. Penn had high hopes for Magill: She had served as the provost of the University of Virginia, where she had previously attended law school. She joined the law school faculty there immediately after serving as a clerk to former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Before her time as Provost at UVa, she served as Dean of Stanford Law.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Her gold-plated resume got her the job. But it didn’t serve her with the skills she needed to navigate one of the most serious crises on campus in recent memory. </p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>The Palestine Writes Literature Festival took place September 22 through September 24 on campus, and it was controversial before it even started. The festival celebrating Palestinian culture was not a student-led event, though students from UPenn and around the Philadelphia area were involved in organizing and volunteering.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Magill and Penn’s leadership faced a enormous backlash from high-profile donors and the Anti-Defamation League about the guest list. Critics said the invited speakers had a history of making antisemitic statements — a characterization the university’s administration acknowledged but organizers and attendees rejected.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Sutskever’s role as chief scientist at OpenAI appears to be unsettled. He was left off Altman’s leadership team list.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>The festival was not organized by the university. Although the university issued a statement prior to the festival condemning antisemitism, it maintained it had a responsibility to uphold the free exchange of ideas on its campus.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Donors remained furious. Weeks later, their simmering animosity toward Magill and the administration turned to a boil.</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <p>But she didn’t last much longer. Magill and Board Chair Scott Bok resigned Saturday evening.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
