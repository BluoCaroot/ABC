                <h2>OpenAI officially announces Sam Altman has returned as
                    CEO and Microsoft gains a non-voting board seat</h2> <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/tech/gettyi.webp" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>Twelve days after OpenAI fired Sam Altman as CEO, the company formally announced that it has hired
                    him back.</p>
                <p>The company also said it has a new board, consisting of Chairman Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of
                    Salesforce; former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers; and Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, who is the sole
                    remaining director from the board that ousted Altman on November 17. Key stakeholder Microsoft has
                    also gained a non-voting observer seat on the company’s board after the company had hired away
                    Altman and former OpenAI Chairman Greg Brockman, only to lose them again to OpenAI a couple of
                    days later – an outcome CEO Satya Nadella said he was fine with.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>OpenAI called the new board “initial,” signaling that it will add more directors in the future.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Altman, in a company blog post, thanked the previous board that fired him for their contributions to
                    the company. He also reinstated Mira Murati as the company’s chief technology officer. Murati was
                    named interim CEO for a little over a day until the company announced that former Twitch CEO Emmett
                    Shear would take over as CEO — a role he held for less than a week.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>The chaos at OpenAI led the vast majority of the company’s 800 employees to threaten to quit unless
                    Altman and Brockman were reinstated. A notable signatory was Ilya Sutskever, a former board member
                    who had played a major role in Altman’s ouster. Sutskever
                    later apologized for his actions, saying he regretted the decision.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Sutskever’s role as chief scientist at OpenAI appears to be unsettled. He was left off Altman’s
                    leadership team list.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>“I love and respect Ilya, I think he’s a guiding light of the field and a gem of a human being,”
                    Altman wrote in the blog post. “I harbor zero ill will towards him. While Ilya will no longer serve
                    on the board, we hope to continue our working
                    relationship and are discussing how he can continue his work at OpenAI.”</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Altman reserved most praise for Brockman, who is returning to the company after he quit. Altman said
                    they will formalize on the company’s
                    org chart the fact that the two are “partners in running this company.”</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <p>“For my part, it is incredibly important to learn from this experience and apply those learnings as
                    we move forward as a company,” Altman wrote on X.
                    “I welcome the board’s independent review of all recent events.”</p> <!-- Article Content -->
