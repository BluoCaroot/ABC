                <h2>This company envisions a future where humanoid robots
                    are as ubiquitous as smartphones</h2> <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/tech/robotics.webp" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Article Image -->
                <p> In the not-so-distant future, human-like robots will be as ubiquitous as the automobile or
                    smartphone
                    – if Agility Robotics’ vision of the future comes to life.</p>
                <p>“This is really an inflection point in history,” said Jonathan Hurst, co-founder of Agility Robotics,
                    a Silicon Valley firm that showed
                    off its humanoid, “Digit” to investors and press Tuesday.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Hurst is an engineer by trade and has been laser focused on building an anthropomorphic robot since
                    college. “Eventually, you [will] just talk to these machines,
                    […] and you can just ask them for help with whatever you want to do.”</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <img src="../../images/tech/stil.webp" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Optional Image -->

                <p>The current model of Digit is limited to loading and unloading bins, stacking items and completing
                    simple tasks. In front of a small audience Tuesday night, the robot showcased its ability to operate
                    autonomously and problem solve in real
                    time, thanks to OpenAI’s ChatGPT 4.0 AI integrated into its software.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>But the demo also revealed how fickle the technology can be during the current testing phase. CNN
                    Correspondent Veronica Miracle asked one Digit to complete a series of tasks via voice command. The
                    command had to be repeated several times, and the robot completed the tasks out of order. Another
                    robot, which was programmed to move bins from a storage rack to a rod conveyor belt,
                    fell over and couldn’t immediately get back up.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Due to safety regulations implemented by Agility Robotics, humans must also stay six feet away from
                    Digit. “We need thousands of hours of robots operating to show and prove the safety case for those
                    before we feel comfortable,” said Hurst. He estimates it could be several years
                    before the robots could move and work seamlessly alongside humans.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>At first glance, “Digit” might elicit memories of a Star Wars battle droid, with a dexterous and
                    upgraded body type. But existing alongside highly intelligent robots is no longer science fiction.
                    Less than two weeks ago, Amazon announced it will begin testing Digit in
                    a Seattle warehouse (Amazon is an investor in Digit’s parent company Agility Robotics.)</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Digit is part of a fleet of Amazon (AMZN) robots being tested, which already has “over 750,000 robots
                    working collaboratively with our employees.” To start, the bipedal humanoid will have a specific
                    task to complete: “Our initial use for this technology will be to help employees with tote
                    recycling, a highly repetitive process of picking up
                    and moving empty totes once inventory has been completely picked out of them.”</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->

                <p>Melonee Wise, Agility’s Chief Technology Officer, boasted about Digit’s potential in more stark
                    terms. “I think that it’s important to recognize that Digit is not just a piece of hardware… we’re a
                    software
                    company. We’re building the platform by which we build an app store for labor.”</p>
