                <h2>Former Twitter head of information security claims he was fired 
                    after raising concerns about cost cuts at Elon Musk’s company</h2> <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/tech/get.jpg" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>The former head of information security at Twitter, now called X, is accusing the company of firing him after he objected to demands
                     by owner Elon Musk and his associates to make cuts to safety systems.</p>
                <p>Shortly after Musk’s takeover of Twitter late last year, the billionaire’s leadership team demanded cuts to physical and digital security that threatened to put the company out of compliance with multiple regulatory requirements and posed a “danger to public safety,” according to the complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in New Jersey, on behalf of former
                     Twitter Global Head of Information Security and Technology Alan Rosa.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>After Rosa raised concerns about the risks of such cuts, he alleges he was removed from one of his regular duties and then abruptly restricted from company systems and terminated “without notice” and having been given “no reason” for his firing.</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <img src="../../images/tech/230713104636-twitter-privacy-file.jpg" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Optional Image -->

                <p>Rosa is accusing X of contract violations and unlawful termination. He initially attempted to handle the issue via private arbitration after having signed an arbitration
                     clause, but X refused to engage, according to the complaint.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Months before Musk took over Twitter, the company agreed to pay a $150 million penalty after the US government accused it of misleading consumers about how it protects their personal data, in violation of a 2011 privacy settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. Twitter also faced claims last year from a former executive-turned-whistleblower about alleged cybersecurity 
                    deficiencies and ongoing non-compliance with the 2011 FTC consent decree.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Within days after Musk’s takeover in late October 2022, legal experts raised concerns that the company may have again violated its consent agreement with the FTC if it had failed to submit a required compliance notice to the regulator
                     within 14 days of the ownership change. (The FTC declined to comment at the time.)</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>The complaint Tuesday from Rosa — who had led information security at the company since January 2022 — offers new insight into the extent of the cuts made by Musk 
                    and the new leadership team he brought in following his acquisition.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>For example, Davis allegedly “did not want to pay” for the company’s vulnerability management software or its ethical hacking program, both of which were “necessary” to comply with the FTC agreement. Davis also directed Rosa to shut down the software systems through which Twitter shared time-sensitive, important information with law enforcement entities, a potential violation
                     of the European Union’s Digital Services Act, the complaint states.</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <p>With the lawsuit, Rosa is seeking to be paid his severance, as well as a $200,000 bonus, more than $300,000 in vested equity compensation and other benefits — money he claims he was denied after the company began what the complaint calls a 
                    “sham investigation” regarding his conduct while he was employed.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
