                <h2>To keep pounds off, patients may need to continue taking weight loss drug, study suggests
                </h2> <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/health/53.jpg" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>People who take the new injectable medication tirzepatide – brand-named Zepbound – to shed pounds
                    will need to stay on it if they want to keep the weight off, a new study confirms.</p>
                <p>Drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound have revolutionized the treatment of obesity,
                    helping people lose significant amounts of weight without surgery. With 70% of Americans overweight
                    or obese, people are clamoring to take them. Soaring demand has outstripped their manufacturers’
                    capacity to make them, reshaped the economy of an entire country, and even has food sellers nervous
                    that grocery markets may shrink as the masses eat less.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>As effective as these medications are, however, they can be hard to take. They are pricey, with a
                    cost of about $1,000 a month before insurance coverage. They can also have significant side effects,
                    like nausea and vomiting, stomach pain and, more rarely, stomach paralysis, pancreatitis, and bowel
                    obstructions. In clinical trials, about 1 in 5 patients who started on the active drugs, didn’t make
                    it to the end of the study.</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <!-- Optional Image -->

                <p>So a looming question about their use has been whether people could eventually stop taking them, or
                    whether the drugs might need to be a lifelong commitment for people wanting to maintain their weight
                    loss.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>A new study published Monday in the medical journal JAMA fills in some of the details by showing what
                    weight regain looks like after people stopped taking Zepbound.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>From the start of the study to the end, the group that stayed on Zepbound weighed an average of 60
                    pounds less and had shed 9 inches from their waist circumference compared with when they entered the
                    trial. People who had been switched to the placebo were down about 22 pounds from their starting
                    weight, and still had trimmed more than 3 inches around their waist.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Aronne says that based on his experience, it’s likely that people on the placebo would continue to
                    regain the weight they lost.p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>“How long would it take? I honestly don’t know,” he said.</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <p>While that may sound depressing for people who had hoped to one day wean off the shots, there were
                    some bright spots in the data,
                    Some people who stop taking the medication don’t seem to gain it back, at least not right away.</p>
