                <h2>Doctors should intervene to help children with obesity, task force draft says, but it doesn’t
                    recommend surgery or meds
                </h2> <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/health/weight-scale-doctors-office-stock.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
                <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>Nearly 20% of all children in the US have what’s considered to be a high body mass index, the measure
                    that practitioners use to determine whether a person has obesity. New draft guidelines released
                    Tuesday by the US Preventive Services Task Force say that doctors should step in to help these
                    children better manage their weight so they can be healthy.</p>
                <p>In the draft guidelines, the task force — a group of independent experts whose recommendations guide
                    doctors’ decisions and influence insurance coverage — recommends that pediatricians refer children 6
                    and older who have obesity to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions based on what it
                    describes as “moderate certainty” that such interventions can provide a “moderate net benefit.” The
                    interventions did not pose any harm.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>But the task force’s draft recommendations do not include weight loss medications or surgery,
                    although it has looked at some research on those interventions. The American Academy of Pediatrics,
                    which updated its own guidelines to manage patients with obesity earlier this year, recommends both
                    options for some patients.</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <!-- Optional Image -->

                <p>And some doctors that treat pediatric patients with obesity said using behavioral interventions only
                    may be difficult for doctors to provide and difficult for families to access, given the extent of
                    the time commitment.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>A high BMI for children is defined a little differently than it is for adults. For adults, a BMI of
                    30 or higher is within the obesity range. A child with obesity is defined as one who is at or above
                    the 95th percentile of kids of their age and gender, based on US Centers for Disease Control and
                    Prevention growth charts. For example, a 10-year-old boy who weighs 102 pounds and is 4 feet 6
                    inches would have a BMI of 22.9. That would put him in the 95th percentile and suggest that he has
                    obesity.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Based on evidence from 50 randomized controlled trials that showed weight loss in children, the task
                    force found, intensive behavioral interventions would need to involve the child and their parent in
                    at least 26 hours of help from a health professional a year.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Interventions could include supervised physical activity sessions, group sessions and individual
                    counseling that teaches children and their parents healthy eating, safe options for exercise,
                    lessons on how to read food labels, behavior change techniques, goal setting, and ways to monitor
                    diet and physical activity.
                </p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>“The feeling initially was that children would grow out of it, and that has been demonstrated to be
                    false,” said Dr. Ilene Fennoy, who as a professor of pediatrics works with children and their
                    parents to help them reach a healthier weight at Columbia University Medical Center. She was not
                    involved with the new draft guidelines.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Weight can fluctuate as children grow, particularly before a growth spurt, she said, but the more
                    severe the level of obesity, the less likely they are to grow out of it.</p>
