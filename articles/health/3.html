                <h2>Why most men don’t have enough close friends</h2> <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/health/men-talking-stock.webp" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>Friendships aren’t just about those you sit with on the school bus or play alongside on your
                    childhood baseball team — they are a core component of the human experience, experts say.
                </p>
                <p>But making and retaining deep, meaningful friendships as an adult is hard, especially for men,
                    according to research.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Less than half of men report being satisfied with their friendships, and only about 1 in 5 said they
                    had received emotional support from a friend in the last week, compared with 4 in 10 women,
                    according to a 2021 survey from the Survey Center on American Life.

                <p>The falling off of friendships between men begins around middle and late adolescence and grows
                    starker in adulthood, said Judy Yi-Chung Chu, who teaches a class on boys’ psychological development
                    at Stanford University. And those who do maintain friendships with other men say they tend to have
                    lower levels of emotional intimacy than women report.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>“Boys don’t start emotionally disconnected; they become emotionally disconnected,” said Dr. Niobe
                    Way, a researcher and a professor of applied psychology at New York University.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>All humans have the innate capacity and desire for close, emotionally intimate connections with
                    others. We need these relationships for survival as babies and then to thrive as we get older, Chu
                    said.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Research has shown close friendships protect our mental and physical health, she added. And men who
                    prioritize those relationships are fighting off one of the most harmful things to human health —
                    loneliness, said Dr. Frank Sileo, a psychologist based in Ridgewood, New Jersey.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>“What (men) are at risk of losing is this sense of not being alone in the world or not being alone in
                    their experience,” Sileo said. Research has shown “disclosure of emotional distress improved (men’s)
                    emotional well-being, increased feelings of being understood and resulted in less reported
                    loneliness,” he added.</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <p>Just as many men strive to eat right, exercise, succeed in their careers and raise children, men
                    should prioritize developing friendships as adults, he said.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
