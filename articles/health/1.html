                <h2>Could the most magical time of year be so full of loneliness, anger and stress?</h2>
                <!-- Article Title -->

                    As the holiday season approaches, many conjure up images of the perfect gathering:
                    comforting aromas of home-cooked feasts, harmonious laughter between friends and family
                    , and thoughts of gratitude that easily roll off the tongue.
                    But for some people, this time of year feels like the exact opposite. It’s a time of stress
                    , emotional turmoil or intense loneliness that looks nothing like the traditional celebration of
                    togetherness.</p>
                <p>Sixty-six percent of people report feeling lonely at the holidays, according to the National Alliance
                    on Mental Illness,
                    while 64% of people with mental illness say that the holidays make their condition worse. And as a
                    child,
                    adolescent and adult psychiatrist, I see these issues firsthand all too often.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Why are loneliness and emotional distress so common this time of year? Some people may be living far
                    from family or may not be able to afford to travel
                    to see them. Others may be grieving the loss of loved ones or navigating strained relationships —
                    and the holidays can serve as a rude reminder of those losses. And for some, the holiday season
                    brings families together who would rather be apart.
                    Whatever the cause, the impact of the holidays on our mental health can be profound.</p>

                <p>Understanding and navigating loneliness :
                    While the holiday season is portrayed as a time for family and social gatherings, that expectation
                    can inadvertently amplify feelings of isolation.
                    That’s true not only for those who find themselves alone, but also for those who are surrounded by
                    loved ones.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>The problem is loneliness is killing us — literally. According to the US surgeon general, Dr. Vivek
                    Murthy, loneliness is as bad for your health as is smoking every day. It can increase your risk of
                    mental health conditions, stroke, heart disease and even premature death.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Fortunately, there are ways to tackle the feeling. If you’ve been feeling lonely this holiday season,
                    the first thing you can do is recognize and name it. Let the feeling roll in as if it’s a fleeting
                    moment that will pass. If you try to resist a feeling, usually it will push back, staying longer
                    than its welcome. If you allow the feeling to float on through you, it can float away just as easily
                    as it came.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Next, see if you can pinpoint the source of the feeling. Do the holidays remind you of the loss of a
                    loved one, or are they connected to a negative experience from your childhood? Or is it that you
                    find yourself comparing yourself with others, only to feel like you aren’t measuring up to your own
                    expectations, set by social comparison?</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Once you identify the trigger for the emotion, you can try to talk to yourself about it with
                    compassion as if you would talk to a friend. Remind yourself that it’s OK to grieve. Tell yourself
                    that comparison is a distraction and put aside your social media. Or remind yourself that you can
                    make investments in relationships if you really want to — you do have some control.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Lastly, find ways for connection with others in the moment. Is there a friend you haven’t texted in a
                    while? A group activity you could join that leaves you with a sense of community? If you don’t have
                    existing connections to turn to, having a brief interaction with a stranger can work as well. Chat
                    with someone outside of your home or better yet offer to help or give something to a stranger. The
                    sense of connection it can foster may surprise you. And it’s good for your health.</p>
