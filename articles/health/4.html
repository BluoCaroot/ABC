                <h2>It’s not too late to get vaccinated, as the holidays – and respiratory virus season – ramp up</h2>
                <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/health/4d.jpg" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>Now is the time to get vaccinated to stay safe and healthy amid holiday gatherings and rising levels
                    of respiratory viruses, including the flu, Covid-19 and RSV, experts say.</p>
                <p>“To protect yourself and your family this holiday season, take the steps that we do every year to
                    protect ourselves,” Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention,
                    said in a video posted to social media Wednesday. “It’s not too late to get vaccinated if you
                    haven’t already.”</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>It takes about two weeks for vaccines to provide optimal protection, so getting the shot now would
                    lead right into Christmas. But the shots offer some additional protection before that, and well
                    after.</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <!-- Optional Image -->
                <p>“Do it right away,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt
                    University. “The bulk of the winter is yet to come, so still protect yourself.”</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>So far this season, vaccination rates are low – but respiratory virus transmission is high.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Weekly hospitalizations for flu, Covid-19 and RSV are on the rise, CDC data shows. During the week
                    ending November 18, there were about 7 new respiratory virus admissions for every 100,000 people,
                    about 35% higher than a month earlier.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Covid-19 levels in wastewater, a leading gauge of viral transmission, are high and rising, while flu
                    is increasing across most of the US and RSV levels are elevated, according to the CDC. And overall,
                    outpatient visits for flu-like illness – a fever, as well as a cough or sore throat – are well above
                    baseline nationally. Levels are high in 15 states, especially across the South.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>The CDC recommends an annual flu vaccine, as well as the updated Covid-19 shot, for everyone age 6
                    months and up. And there’s a new RSV vaccine this year, recommended for those 60 and older.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>“Use additional layers of protection like avoiding people who are sick, washing your hands, improving
                    ventilation and wearing a mask,” Cohen said. “And if you do get sick, I know it’s hard, but stay
                    home so you don’t spread germs to others. And get tested so you know what you have and get
                    treatment.”</p> <!-- Article Content -->
