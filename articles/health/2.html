                <h2>Being a nice person is not the same as being kind. Why the difference is so important</h2>
                <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/health/de.jpg" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>When my father died of bone cancer last year, I received an outpouring of messages from friends and
                    family sharing their condolences.
                    While I appreciated everyone who reached out, I was especially grateful for two of my former college
                    roommates who surprised my family with a delivery of bagels for breakfast. Although there was a
                    mix-up with the address and we never saw those bagels, this act of kindness stuck with me. It was
                    the intention that mattered more than the actual food.</p>
                <p>There’s a difference between nice and being kind—even our bodies recognize the distinction. Kindness
                    not only pours a lot of good into the world, but it’s also good for one’s own health. It doesn’t
                    take much to harness the power of kindness, and it can be as simple as wishing someone a good day
                    over text.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Being nice versus being kind
                    When was the last time you were nice? You might recall saluting a veteran for their service or
                    greeting a stranger. Being nice involves being polite and pleasing to others. This might feel less
                    authentic and rewarding than performing kind acts, said Dr. Carla Marie Manly, a clinical
                    psychologist and author of the upcoming book, “The Joy of Imperfect Love.”</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->

                <!-- Optional Image -->

                <p>“If you’re people pleasing, you’re placing an expectation on the person you’re being nice to that
                    they respond to you in a certain way,” Manly said.
                    Niceness can be used as a social strategy to get into someone’s good graces, she said. Think about
                    the last time you complimented someone’s outfit but didn’t actually mean it. Did you do it to make
                    them like you or did you feel obligated to comment on their new look since everyone else did?</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Being kind is less self-serving, said Dr. Ash Nadkarni, an associate psychiatrist and director of
                    wellness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Massachusetts. On the one hand, kindness involves being
                    generous without expecting to get nothing in return. The other half is the purpose behind the
                    action. A kind person is acting out of compassion and genuine concern for another.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>The difference is intentionality, said Dr.
                    Catherine Franssen, an associate professor of psychology at Longwood University in Virginia, noting
                    that a kind person tries to really understand what someone else is going through.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Practicing kindness rather than niceness allows people to foster deeper genuine connections with
                    others, said Franssen. The more you do it, the easier it will get to relate to others and build more
                    meaningful relationships in all aspects of life.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>When people act kindly, the brain releases a hormone called oxytocin. Popularly known as the “love
                    hormone,” oxytocin is used to promote social connection with others. Nadkarni said that the influx
                    of oxytocin in the brain dampens activity in the amygdala, a region involved in fear and anxiety.
                    “It suppresses the fear sensation and has a powerful impact on the socioemotional functions of the
                    brain.”</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <p>If you have ever felt less stressed from helping others, it’s all thanks to the calming effects of
                    oxytocin. It reduces cortisol, the stress hormone that triggers inflammation and a fight-or-flight
                    response when the body senses a potential threat, be it a wild animal or an email from your boss.
