                <h2>A police officer’s death has torn this Boston suburb apart</h2> <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/news/police-officer-killing-boston.webp" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>
                    In the pre-dawn hours of January 29, 2022, a man was found dead in a blizzard outside a house in
                    suburban Boston. He was wearing two shirts, blue jeans, socks and one black Nike sneaker. On the
                    blanket of snow near his body were shards of glass and splotches of blood.</p>
                <p>His name was John O’Keefe, and he was a Boston police officer.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>O’Keefe and his girlfriend of two years, Karen Read, had been on a bar crawl earlier that night.
                    Shortly after midnight, according to court documents, they climbed into her black Lexus SUV and
                    headed to an afterparty
                    at the home of a fellow Boston police officer on Fairview Road in Canton.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->

                <img src="../../images/news/231116145239-04-police-officer-killing-boston.webp" alt="" srcset="">
                <!-- Optional Image -->

                <p>About six hours later, O’Keefe’s body was spotted in the front yard of the house, covered in snow.
                    But what happened during those six hours has sharply
                    divided Canton, a town of 24,000 people about 15 miles southwest of Boston.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Residents of the town and neighboring suburbs have spent months debating two potential scenarios: Was
                    O’Keefe beaten inside the house and
                    tossed outside to die in the snow? Or did his girlfriend fatally strike him with her car?
                </p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Local prosecutors have made their position clear, charging Read with second-degree murder, vehicular
                    manslaughter
                    while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision. She has pleaded not guilty, and her trial is
                    set for March.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p> “I think that confrontation got physical, and he was beaten to a point of unconsciousness,” Jackson
                    said.
                    “This was a coverup … he was murdered inside that house and his body placed outside.”</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>In Read’s charging documents, Albert and his wife told police that O’Keefe and Read joined their
                    group at Waterfall Bar & Grille, the second bar in Canton. The Alberts said they invited some people
                    from the bar to their house but were not aware O’Keefe and Read were
                    coming over. The Alberts added they didn’t know O’Keefe or Read that well but wouldn’t have minded
                    if they’d come.</p>
                <p>The Alberts also told police they “neither heard nor saw anything outside of their home over the
                    course of the morning,” according to court documents. The Fairview Road house was sold in April.
                    Jackson said that the Alberts
                    owned a German shepherd, which he believes is responsible for some of the bruises found on O’Keefe.
