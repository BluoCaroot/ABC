                <h2>Humanitarian crisis worsens in Gaza as Israel-Hamas war intensifies</h2> <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/news/5b0c20ba-5fea - Copy.jpg" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>Israel continues to battle Hamas in several parts of Gaza, including in the main southern city of
                    Khan Younis, where residents have been urged to evacuate to an area with few facilities on the
                    coast. Israel's military said Sunday it struck more than 250 Hamas targets in the past 24 hours,
                    including a military communications site.</p>
                <p>Israel and Hamas are not not showing the "same willingness" as before last month’s week-long truce to
                    resolve the war, Qatar's prime minister, a key negotiator, said Sunday, while also condemning the
                    humanitarian situation in the enclave. His comments came as the UN secretary general said he "will
                    not give up" calling for a ceasefire in Gaza after the Secretary Council failed to pass a resolution
                    to do so.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Israel's national security adviser said Israel has so far killed 7,000 Hamas fighters, calling it a
                    "minimal estimate." But the Palestinian prime minister said Israel's goal of destroying Hamas was
                    "not going to happen."</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <img src="../../images/news/ai2html- - Copy.jpg" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Optional Image -->

                <p>WHO's chief called the impact of the conflict on the health care system in Gaza "catastrophic" as
                    fighting rages on. More than 17,500 people have been killed since the conflict began, the Hamas-run
                    ministry of health in Gaza says.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>As his city in southern Gaza has become a major focus of Israel’s ground operations, the 38-year-old
                    said he has moved his wife and 18-month-old son to a neighbor's ground floor flat to feel a little
                    bit safer.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>But finding essential food and drinkable water remains a major challenge, he told CNN on a phone
                    call.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>The price of basic items like flour has gone up eight-fold since the start of the conflict, and
                    cooking gas, in particular, is in very short supply, he said.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>The couple started using plastic and cardboard to make fire to cook food.

                    As evening set in, the intensity of artillery fire reduced slightly, Naseem added, but the sounds of
                    ground clashes and military vehicles became closer.</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <p>About Khan Younis: The city is located in the southern part of the Gaza strip. It was where thousands
                    of Palestinians fled to earlier in the war when Israel called for an evacuation of northern Gaza and
                    directed residents southwards. Now, on Saturday, Israel issued another “urgent appeal” for
                    evacuation — this time asking civilians of Khan Younis to move to an area on the coast, which has
                    few facilities. It is unclear how many people were aware of the instruction given the lack of
                    communications networks and internet availability in much of Gaza. </p> <!-- Article Content -->
