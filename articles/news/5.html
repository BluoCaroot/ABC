                <h2>Google reaches deal with Canada to keep news content on its platform
                </h2> <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/news/google-headquarters-file-2023-restricted.webp" alt="" srcset="">
                <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>Google has agreed to pay Canadian publishers for their news content, backing down from a high-stakes
                    threat to block all news content produced in the country on its platforms after the tech giant and
                    the Canadian government announced a deal Wednesday to avert the looming crisis.</p>
                <p>The agreement resolves tensions between Google and Canada over a controversial law known as C-18
                    requiring digital platforms to compensate news publishers for their work.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>And it is the latest twist in a global debate over the role digital platforms play in facilitating —
                    or stifling — news publishers, particularly small, independent outlets.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Under the announced deal with Google, details of which remain murky because the law’s final
                    regulations have yet to be formally published, the search giant will pay $100 million CAD ($73.5
                    million US) a year into a fund that will be distributed to publishers. Google’s contributions will
                    be indexed to inflation, the Canadian government said.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>In addition, instead of negotiating with individual publishers over payment, Google “will have the
                    option to work with a single collective to distribute its contribution to all interested eligible
                    news businesses based on the number of full-time equivalent journalists engaged by those
                    businesses,” said Canadian Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge in a statement.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>It was not immediately clear how the collective might function or be governed; a spokesperson for
                    St-Onge didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>“We are pleased that the Government of Canada has committed to addressing our core issues with Bill
                    C-18,” said Google President of Global Affairs Kent Walker in a statement, adding: “While we work
                    with the government through the exemption process based on the regulations that will be published
                    shortly, we will continue sending valuable traffic to Canadian publishers.”</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>The Google agreement marks a departure from the path taken by Instagram-parent Meta, which opted to
                    pull news content from its platforms in Canada in response to C-18. Meta announced its plans to
                    block news for its Canadian users in June and began rolling out the change in August.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->

                <p>At around the time, Google had also threatened to “remove links to Canadian news from our Search,
                    News and Discover products in Canada,” and warned that C-18 would “make it untenable for us to
                    continue offering our Google News Showcase product in Canada.”</p> <!-- Article Content -->
