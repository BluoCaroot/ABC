                <h2>The US economy added 199,000 jobs in November</h2> <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/news/ages-1760543633.webp" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>The US economy notched another solid month of job growth, with an added lift from actors and
                    autoworkers coming off the picket lines.</p>
                <p>Employers added 199,000 jobs in November, and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.7% from 3.9% the
                    month before, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>“The economy’s still humming along,” Jane Oates, a former Department of Labor official who is
                    president of employment education nonprofit WorkingNation, told CNN. “For the past two weeks, all
                    we’ve heard is doom and gloom about how this is going to be a terrible day. And it was a much better
                    day than was predicted.”</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Economists were expecting net job gains of 180,000 for the month and for the unemployment rate to
                    hold steady, according to Refinitiv.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>The labor force participation rate ticked up 0.1 percentage points to 62.8%, returning to its highest
                    level since the onset of the pandemic. The participation rate increase is a “positive underlying
                    context to the unemployment rate decline,” wrote Daniel Zhao, Glassdoor’s lead economist, in
                    commentary issued Friday.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>The largest employment gains last month came in health care and government, which added an estimated
                    93,200 and 49,000 jobs, respectively. Manufacturing saw a boost, too, largely because of the return
                    of striking autoworkers, which lifted motor vehicles and parts employment by 30,000 jobs.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Additionally, the resolution of the Screen Actors Guild strike against Hollywood studios resulted in
                    17,200 jobs added in the motion picture and sound recording industries.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>In total, the BLS was anticipating a net gain of 35,000 workers returning after strikes: The agency
                    estimated that 61,000 workers were absent from the labor market due to labor disputes, versus 96,000
                    the month before.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Taking into account those one-time gains, the underlying rate of job growth is likely around 160,000
                    jobs per month, which aligns with the 2019 average, wrote Julia Pollak, senior economist with
                    ZipRecruiter.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
