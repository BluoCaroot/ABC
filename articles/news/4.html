                <h2>US government’s proposal to boost EV sales is challenging but not impossible
                </h2> <!-- Article Title -->
                <img src="../../images/news/gm-chevy-blazer-suv.jpg" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Article Image -->
                <p>The US government is planning to change auto emissions standards in a way that means automakers would
                    need to sell a lot more electric vehicles. By 2032, electric vehicles would need to make up about
                    two-thirds of all the new cars sold in America.</p>
                <p>Without these requirements, electric vehicles would have reached that sort of market share sometime
                    after 2035, according to Moody’s industry analyst Matthias Heck. The goals laid out by the EPA are
                    manageable, he said, but it won’t be easy and high levels of investment would be needed. For now,
                    the proposal is still just that, a proposal, and could well change before before being finalized,
                    Heck pointed out.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>Over the next decade things will change a lot, including charging infrastructure and the vehicles
                    themselves. Consumers will be drawn to electric vehicles more as battery technology improves and
                    prices drop. And government incentives, like those under the new Inflation Reduction Act, will help,
                    too.</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <img src="../../images/news/combustion-engine-debate.jpg" alt="" srcset=""> <!-- Optional Image -->

                <p>It’s important to remember that, nearly a decade from now, electric vehicles are going to be
                    different from what’s on the market today, said Chris Harto a policy analyst for transportation and
                    energy at Consumer Reports. And even as EV market share rises to two-thirds, it’s not like EVs will
                    flood America’s roads overnight, he said. Eighty percent of the cars on the roads in 2032 will still
                    be gas-powered, he said, but shopping for a new vehicle will be different.</p>
                <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>‘We’re talking about past cost parity, so it’s going to be the same price or cheaper,” compared to a
                    gas-powered car, he said.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>At the same time, driving ranges will increase, fast charging will be easier and more accessible and
                    owners will enjoy greatly reduced operating costs, Harto said. Moody’s Heck predicted that
                    next-generation EV batteries expected in the next few years will go 30% further on a charge and will
                    recharge 30% faster.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>So when combined with improved charging networks – something else that can be expected over that time
                    – electric cars won’t be a particularly hard sell for consumers who are just looking for the best
                    vehicle at a good price, Harto said.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
                <p>There will also be more electric vehicle models available by 2032. Today, there are “EV equivalents”
                    available for roughly 40% of the gas vehicle models Americans can buy, according to Elizabeth Krear,
                    vice president of the electric vehicle practice at JD Power. Electric market share now stands at
                    8.5%.</p> <!-- Article Content -->

                <p>Krear did not specifically comment on the chances of EVs making up two-thirds of the US auto market
                    by 2032. But by 2026, just three years from now, Krear expects there will be “EV equivalents” for
                    75% of the vehicles Americans shop for and market share will have already tripled to 27%. In
                    California, where EVs are more popular and there are more models available, EV market share is
                    already expected to reach the two-thirds mark before 2032.</p> <!-- Article Content -->
